Review the current code or changes and minimize:

1. Remove unnecessary abstractions - inline single-use functions/classes
2. Remove defensive code for impossible cases
3. Remove comments that restate what code does
4. Simplify control flow where possible
5. Remove unused imports, variables, and dead code
6. Prefer standard library over custom implementations

The goal is the simplest working solution. Don't add anything not explicitly needed.
